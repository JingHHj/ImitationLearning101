# ImitationLearning101
A framework that uses imitaiton learning to solve basic manipulation tasks in simulation, including:
1. Data collection using teleoperation
2. Data preprocessing
3. Model implementation and training


## 1. Data Collection
| Methods | Description |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| ***[TeleDex](https://github.com/omarrayyann/TeleDex) (MujocoAR)*** | A framework that allows you to connect your phone to the end-effector of your robot and control with by simply just moving it. |
| ***PS4 Controller*** | Using the joysticks on the PS4 controller to control the position and orientation of the end-effector |



## 2. Data Pre-processing
## 3. Models
